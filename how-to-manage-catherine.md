# Motivations

- **Helping others**: I love solving problems and I love solving problems for my teammates even more.
- **Learning**: I'm constantly learning in and out of the work environment. I love learning new things. I especially love working with technologies that challenge me and help me grow.
- **Reaching goals**: I work well when I have clear, measurable goals and regularly make progress towards them.
- **Time management**: I work best when things are organized and our team plans to the best of our abilities.
- **Getting stuff done**: I’m happiest when I’m regularly shipping out new features. CICD!
- **Having fun**: Humor and playfulness help me establish trust with my teammates and stay motivated to do my best work. Sometimes I can be too serious, so the playfulness helps me be more present!
- **Equality**: I am passionate for getting more women into tech/software development roles.

# Needs

## From Manager

- Establishing a career path and figuring out an action plan on how to get there
- Help setting measurable goals and ensuring I have opportunities to meet them
- Protecting my time since context switching can really hurt my productivity
- Clear, actionable, and regular feedback so I can improve. What should I start/stop/continue doing?
- I do love praise! (But I also want to get better everyday!)
- Ensuring my contributions (technical and otherwise!) are valued and highlighted
- Providing me with (more than) enough time to complete large projects (ASAP)

## From Teammates

- Clear, actionable, and regular feedback so I can improve
- Direct communication (try to provide as much detail as possible)
- Clear expectations of when their requests will be needed for them to be successful

# Schedule

- I concentrate best in the afternoons. This is when I prefer to do most of my coding work. I tend to prefer meetings and collaborative work in the mornings. I am pinged less in the afternoons :) 
- I try to dedicate time to focus and time to break
- Slack sounds are turned off on my computer because that is how I work best but still check every ~10 minutes
- Getting off slack completely helps me sometimes and I do communicate to my team when that happens

# Goals

## Near term

- Ramp up on team technologies so I can work autonomously ~100% of the time --> shoutout Nick
- Understand the context of my work more — why it’s important, who the users are, etc.
- Familiarize myself with other marketing aspects that can ultimately benefit our website
- Network with Mailgun engineers more/possibly mentorship
- Figure out a career path/possibilities

## Long term

- Mentor others
- Possibly have an intern (I love to teach!)
- Lead a team of front end devs who focus on digital marketing and upkeeping an efficient codebase
- Develop enough product & codebase expertise so others come to me for questions
- I struggle with public speaking -- it makes me very nervous. I would like to work on this!
